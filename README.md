Complete code from Loom Network's [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course) Solidity tutorial
- This is my first experience with developing Smart Contracts and Solidity
- In my opinion, smart contract development is very intriguing due to the immutable, decentralized, and financial nature of using blockchain in a back-end architecture
- CryptoZombies got me very excited and passionate about learning Solidity, web3 JavaScript libraries, frameworks like OpenZeppelin, and the decentralized infrastructure behind Ethereum
